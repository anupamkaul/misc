Your Ubuntu 22.04 audio keeps fixing and losing out due to potential conflicts between PulseAudio (which it uses) and PipeWire (which comes later), incorrect device selection, or driver issues, often appearing as "Dummy Output" after sleep/suspend; try restarting the sound service with pulseaudio --kill && pulseaudio --start, ensuring the right device is chosen in Settings, checking physical connections, and updating your system. 
Quick Fixes (Try these first)
Restart Sound Service: Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:
bash
pulseaudio --kill && pulseaudio --start
Then restart apps like VLC if needed.
Check Sound Settings: Go to Settings > Sound > Output, and confirm the correct device (e.g., Speakers, Headphones) is selected and not muted.
Physical Check: Unplug and replug headphones/speakers; check Bluetooth pairing. 
Deeper Troubleshooting
If "Dummy Output" Appears (Common after Suspend): The above pulseaudio commands often fix this.
Update System: Ensure everything is current:
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Then reboot.
Check ALSA Mixer: For low-level control:
bash
alsamixer
Press F6 to select your sound card and check all levels are up and not muted (MM means muted).
Check for PipeWire (If on newer 22.04/updates): If you're on a newer build, PipeWire might be involved. Restart it:
bash
systemctl --user restart pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service
.
Install/Reinstall PulseAudio (If missing):
bash
sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
pulseaudio --start
. 
Advanced (If issues persist)
Restart Hardware (Power Cycle): Shut down, remove the battery (if possible), hold the power button for 10 seconds to drain residual power, then restart.
Look for Driver Issues: While less common in Ubuntu, sometimes removing and reinstalling the audio driver can help, but rebooting usually handles this as drivers reinstall automatically.

In this instance, pulseaudio isn't running for me, as evidenced by:

pulseaudio --kill && pulseaudio --start
E: [pulseaudio] main.c: Failed to kill daemon: No such process

pulseaudio --start
E: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup failed.

----

The error E: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup failed means PulseAudio couldn't start, often due to a corrupt config, permission issue, or conflict, but can usually be fixed by killing existing processes (pulseaudio -k), removing the config folder (rm -rf ~/.config/pulse), restarting, or ensuring your user is in the audio group. Running with higher verbosity (pulseaudio -vvv) or checking logs with journalctl can give more clues if basic steps fail. 
Common Fixes
Kill Existing Processes & Restart:
pulseaudio -k (or killall pulseaudio).
pulseaudio --start (or start-pulseaudio-x11 if using X).
Reset Configuration:
mv ~/.config/pulse ~/.config/pulse.old (renames the folder).
rm -rf ~/.config/pulse (deletes it, forcing regeneration).
Then try pulseaudio --start or reboot.
Check User Permissions:
Ensure your user is in the audio group: sudo usermod -aG audio $USER.
Log out and log back in after changing groups. 
Advanced Troubleshooting
Verbose Output: pulseaudio -vvv --daemonize=false (run as your user) to see detailed errors in the terminal.
System Logs: journalctl -b | grep pulseaudio or systemctl --user status pulseaudio.service for systemd logs.
Configuration Files: Temporarily rename or move ~/.config/pulse/default.pa to check for module issues.
Reinstall: sudo apt purge pulseaudio && sudo apt install pulseaudio pavucontrol (Debian/Ubuntu). 
Potential Conflicts
If you see inotify errors, another application (like Ulauncher) might be interfering; try closing it.
