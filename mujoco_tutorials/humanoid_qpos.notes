In MuJoCo, mjData.qpos stores the configuration in generalized coordinates (positions), while mjData.qvel 
stores the generalized velocities. For the standard Humanoid model, these vectors follow a specific, fixed 
order based on the kinematic tree defined in the model's XML file.
 
Interpreting mjData.qpos

The qpos vector for the default Humanoid has 22 elements. The elements are ordered as follows: 

qpos[0:3] (Root Position): The (x, y, z) global Cartesian coordinates of the humanoid's main torso (root body). 
By default in some environments, the first two (x, y) coordinates might be excluded from the observation space, 
but they exist in mjData.qpos.

qpos[3:7] (Root Orientation): A unit quaternion (w, x, y, z) representing the global orientation of the torso.

qpos[7:...] (Joint Positions): The scalar position values (angles in radians for hinge joints) for all other joints 
in the kinematic tree, in the order they appear in the XML model. This typically includes:

qpos[7:10]: Hinge joint angles for the abdomen (e.g., in x, y, z axes).

qpos[10:13]: Hinge joint angles for the right hip (e.g., angle for the hip's x, y, z axes).

qpos[13]: Hinge joint angle for the right knee.

qpos[14:16]: Hinge joint angles for the right ankle.

qpos[16:19]: Hinge joint angles for the left hip.

qpos[19]: Hinge joint angle for the left knee.

qpos[20:22]: Hinge joint angles for the left ankle.
 
Interpreting mjData.qvel

The qvel vector has 23 elements. The dimensionality of qpos and qvel can differ because quaternions (4 values in qpos) 
represent 3 degrees of freedom (3 values in qvel). The elements are ordered analogously to qpos:
 
qvel[0:3] (Root Linear Velocity): The (x, y, z) global linear velocity of the torso.

qvel[3:6] (Root Angular Velocity): The (x, y, z) global angular velocity of the torso in its tangent space 
(not quaternion derivatives).

qvel[6:...] (Joint Velocities): The scalar velocities (derivatives of the angles) for all other joints, matching the 
order in qpos:

qvel[6:9]: Velocities for the abdomen hinge joints.
qvel[9:12]: Velocities for the right hip hinge joints.
qvel[12]: Velocity for the right knee hinge joint.
qvel[13:15]: Velocities for the right ankle hinge joints.
qvel[15:18]: Velocities for the left hip hinge joints.
qvel[18]: Velocity for the left knee hinge joint.
qvel[19:21]: Velocities for the left ankle hinge joints.
Note: There are an additional two dimensions in qvel for the arms, which are often not actuated in the default 
environment configuration but are part of the model's degrees of freedom, leading to a total of 23 elements. 

Key Points

The exact structure and number of elements can vary if the underlying MJCF XML model file is modified.
The best way to be certain of the order for a specific model is to inspect the model's XML file or use the MuJoCo API 
to retrieve joint names and their corresponding indices.

qpos stores positions, and qvel stores their time derivatives (velocities). `
