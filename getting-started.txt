Installing PyTorch on Ubuntu 24.04 can be done using pip, preferably within a Python virtual environment.
1. Prepare your system:
Update your package list.
Code

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
Install Python 3 and venv if not already present:
Code

    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv -y
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
Create a virtual environment (e.g., named pytorch_env):
Code

    python3 -m venv pytorch_env
Activate the virtual environment.
Code

    source pytorch_env/bin/activate
(Your terminal prompt will change to indicate the active virtual environment.)
3. Install PyTorch:
If you need GPU support, ensure you have NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installed on your system. PyTorch binaries ship with CUDA runtime libraries, so you primarily need the NVIDIA driver.
Visit the official PyTorch website's "Get Started" section (pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Select your operating system (Linux), package manager (Pip), language (Python), and desired compute platform (CPU or CUDA).
Copy the generated installation command and run it within your active virtual environment. For example, for CPU-only:
Code

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
Or for CUDA support (replace cu121 with your CUDA version if different):
Code

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
4. Verify the installation:
Open a Python interpreter within your virtual environment:
Code

    python
Import PyTorch and perform a basic check:
Python

    import torch
    print(torch.__version__)
If you installed with CUDA support, verify GPU availability:
Python

    print(torch.cuda.is_available())
This should return True if CUDA is correctly set up.
5. Deactivate the virtual environment (when finished):
```bash.
Oops, something went wrong.
